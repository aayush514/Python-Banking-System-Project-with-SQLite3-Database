Project Overview:
The Python Banking System project is a command-line application that simulates basic banking operations, including viewing bank details, managing customer data, and handling credit or debit transactions. It uses SQLite3 for database management to store and retrieve customer information such as names, ages, mobile numbers, account numbers, email IDs, passwords, and balance amounts.

Key Functionalities:
-> View Bank Details: Displays all customer records stored in the database.
-> Manage Customer Data: Adds, modifies, or removes customer data.
-> Credit/Debit Transactions: Allows users to credit or debit amounts from their accounts.
-> Authentication: Validates user credentials before providing access to sensitive data.

I will create a basic README.md file for your GitHub repository, highlighting these functionalities, along with instructions on how to run the project.
# Python Banking System Project

## Overview
This project is a command-line-based banking system that allows users to manage bank accounts, view customer details, and perform credit/debit transactions. The application is developed using Python and uses an SQLite3 database (`Banking_System.db`) to store customer information securely.

## Features
> View Bank Details**: Access all stored customer records, including name, age, mobile number, account number, email, and balance.
-> Customer Data Management**: Add, modify, or delete customer information in the database.
-> Transaction Handling**: Perform credit or debit transactions on user accounts.
-> User Authentication**: Ensure secure access with credential validation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- SQLite3
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the `.ipynb` file)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python-Banking-System.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Python-Banking-System
    ```

3. Install required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: Create a `requirements.txt` file if necessary, listing all dependencies.)*

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Banking System.ipynb"
    ```

## Usage
1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in the provided order.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to:
    - View bank details.
    - Manage customer data.
    - Perform credit or debit transactions.
    - Exit the application.

## Database
The application uses an SQLite3 database (`Banking_System.db`) to manage customer data. Make sure the database file is in the same directory as the notebook.
